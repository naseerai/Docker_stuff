# Docker CLI Command : docker `stop` 

The docker stop command is used to stop one or more running Docker containers. This command allows Docker to terminate the container(s) gracefully, giving them a chance to complete any ongoing processes before stopping completely.

### Syntax

```bash
docker stop [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [CONTAINER...]   
```

*   **CONTAINER**: The name or ID of the container you want to stop. You can specify multiple containers at once by separating their names or IDs with a space.
    

### Example

## 1. Pull the ubuntu Image

```bash
        docker pull ubuntu
